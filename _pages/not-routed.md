<p class="type-l">
    This domain points to fortrabbit but it isn't associated with any App. Are you the developer? You might want to go to the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.fortrabbit.com) to add this domain to your App.
</p>

You may:

* recently upgraded your App and your DNS cache is not - yet - refreshed.
* used A records not CNAME for routing, now the App was moved.
* some mismatch with naked domain (domain.tld) and subdomain (blog.domain.tld).

Also see our [domain help article](https://help.fortrabbit.com/about-domains) for more information.
